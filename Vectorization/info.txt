In a entire array apply operation at a time in every element is Vectorization 

Loops in python is very slow to do that speacially in big data set


Broadcasting -> 1. it expand smalller array to larger array
                2. faster then Loops
                3. 1D to 2D operation 

vectorization -> 1. operation entire array very large
                 2. 100x then Loops
                 3. used in matrix operation
